Read the press release and download the final plan.\n\n\nThe plan focuses high density housing around the rail system on the southern side of the island with neighborhood-scale infill housing around the island’s other communities.\nAs part of its commitment to tackling Honolulu’s housing challenges, the City is taking a proactive approach to addressing the housing shortage by:\n\nPartnering with developers to activate underutilized public lands\nExploring innovative financing strategies to unlock new resources\nCentralizing housing functions to streamline development, finance, and policy efforts—enabling faster project delivery and improved coordination of housing initiatives\nKey initiatives of the Strategic Housing Plan include:\n\nExpanding Transit-Oriented Development (TOD): The Skyline rail system presents an unprecedented opportunity to create high-density, mixed-use communities along its nearly 20-mile route. Concentrating growth in the Primary Urban Center, TOD corridors helps preserve rural areas while integrating housing, offices, retail, education, and government services. This approach reduces commute times, lowers transportation costs, and supports Honolulu’s sustainability goals.\nActivating the Kūwili Station TOD Redevelopment Area: The Kūwili Station area presents a transformative opportunity for an underserved community. The City and State’s land holdings in this area will help improve connectivity, address environmental concerns, and mitigate flood risks. The Strategic Housing Plan builds off of the Downtown Neighborhood TOD Plan, which was created after almost a decade of extensive community engagement and input. The plan envisions thousands of housing units within a vibrant mixed-use district, backed by $2.7 million in federal and state grants for infrastructure and master planning.\nAccelerating Housing Development: The City is leveraging underutilized public lands and streamlining procurement processes to expedite partnerships with local developers. An example of this success is Parkway Village at Kapolei—a mixed-use development on City-owned land featuring 401 housing units and two on-site preschools—completed in just over a year through effective public-private collaboration.\nEnhancing Housing Finance Strategies: Existing funding sources for affordable housing, including General Obligation Bonds, Private Activity Bonds, and the Affordable Housing Fund (Ordinance 7-19), are limited. The City is committed to exploring new financing strategies that will expand resources and create additional opportunities for housing development.\nReorganizing Housing Functions: For nearly three decades, the City has lacked a centralized housing department. As announced in Mayor Blangiardi’s 2024 State of the City address, the City plans to consolidate its housing programs under the proposed Department of Housing and Land Management (DHLM). This restructuring will improve efficiency, accelerate project delivery, and enhance coordination of housing initiatives.",

Building on the foundation set by the 2019 HPP, this new plan focuses on achieving the state’s goal of more than 10% affordable housing units. The plan includes a needs assessment based on demographic analysis and market trends, which identify pressing housing challenges, such as housing attainability and cost burdens for residents. Additionally, the plan outlines the importance of meeting the housing needs of growing income groups, particularly the 30-60% AMI category, and accommodating Lancaster’s aging population.\n\nWhat is a Housing Production Plan?\nBy state statute MGL Chapter 40B, cities and towns are required to provide more than 10% of their total year-round housing units as deed-restricted Affordable Housing. Affordable Housing is deed-restricted housing that eligible low- and moderate-income residents can afford by paying no more than 30% of their annual household income. Lancaster has 3,053 housing units, per the 2022 Census ACS 5-Year estimate, of which 188 (or about 6.2%) are deed-restricted Affordable Housing units on the state’s Subsidized Housing Inventory (SHI).\n\nThe number of households in Lancaster has been growing at a rate of 2.3% a year since 2010\n\nDigital report\nCommunityScale created an open source report dashboard to outline the plan's objectives and priorities, share key observations and findings about the local housing landscape, and highlight recommended strategies to increase housing production and address affordability challenges. Learn more about our digital products.\n\n\nCrafting strategies\nWe worked with the client and Levine Planning Strategies to create five housing goals and a suite of regulatory changes and local programs to address affordability.\n\nThe plan's actionable strategies include zoning changes, town land disposition, and an increase in the Community Preservation Act rate. Through community engagement initiatives, Lancaster has identified support for flexible zoning and smaller homes while preserving neighborhood character. Public utility expansions and increased Affordable Housing Trust funding are additional recommendations, ensuring that Lancaster has the infrastructure and financial tools to support the anticipated housing demand. This HPP emphasizes a proactive approach to affordable housing, designed to align with broader community objectives of economic growth, sustainability, and inclusivity.",

This project responds to the area’s increasing momentum: a resurgent downtown, a growing population, and transformative projects such as Micron’s regional investment and the impending I-81 viaduct removal.\n\n\nCommunityScale worked closely with Downtown Syracuse staff to deliver a data-driven, context-sensitive analysis of current conditions, market dynamics, and projected needs over a 5-10 year horizon. The process included robust stakeholder input with local employers, developers, residents, nonprofit leaders, and policymakers to ground recommendations in both community insight and market realities.\n\nThe study highlighted Downtown Syracuse’s evolving role as the region’s residential core. Key findings included:\n\nStrong residential market demand, with an estimated market potential for approximately 176 new units per year supported by projected population growth and Downtown’s appeal to younger householders and newcomers.\nA predominance of demand for smaller rental units, especially studios and one-bedrooms priced between $1,500 and $2,000 per month.\nA growing demographic profile, driven primarily by householders aged 25-44, with half of new residents moving from outside Onondaga County.\nFavorable policy conditions, including ReZone Syracuse’s flexible MX-5 zoning which supports dense residential development with minimal regulatory barriers.\nThe study provided a clear-eyed market benchmark by comparing Downtown Syracuse to peer neighborhoods in Syracuse and other upstate cities such as Rochester and Buffalo. It also examined how transformative regional initiatives like the Micron facility and the I-81 Community Grid will unlock new development opportunities and drive housing demand.\n\nCommunityScale developed a custom, interactive online dashboard that visualizes key metrics and makes the findings accessible to a broader audience. These tools equip the Downtown Committee, developers, and other stakeholders with actionable insights for near-term and long-term planning, investment decisions, and policy alignment.\n\nUltimately, the Downtown Syracuse Housing Needs Assessment and Market Study charts a path forward for continued residential growth in Downtown, ensuring that future development responds to emerging market trends while strengthening Downtown as a vibrant, livable, and inclusive urban neighborhood.\n\nLearn more:\nDowntown Syracuse Housing Needs Assessment and Market Study Dashboard",

    "desc": "CommunityScale authored a complete rezoning of the City of Lynn with Levine Planning Strategies, led by Jeff Levine, and BBHS Law, led by Jonathan Silverstein. The zoning rewrite was adopted unanimously by the Lynn City Council on June 24, 2025.\n\nThe rewrite focused on translating the City’s vision into a practical and effective zoning framework. A technical audit at the outset revealed that just 4% of Lynn’s residential parcels actually complied with the old code. The new ordinance corrects that mismatch, delivers a user-friendly structure, and supports twenty-first century economic, housing, and sustainability goals.\n\nWhat Changed and Why It Matters\nPredictable approvals replace use variances. Stakeholders told the City that routine projects often require variance for land use and dimensional relief, which created an unpredictable process for owners and residents. The new ordinance eliminates use variances altogether and updates the use and dimensional table to reflect the reality on the ground and the community’s vision. When a proposal needs discretionary review, the elected City Council now holds that authority through a clear special-permit process with written criteria, giving both neighbors and applicants a shared understanding of what counts.\n\nRight-sized dimensional rules calibrated to real neighborhoods. Front setbacks, lot widths, height limits, and coverage ratios were rebuilt using block-by-block data. Triple-deckers, duplexes, and other long-established building types finally fit the rules. Homeowners and builders can now create infill housing at a scale that matches the existing neighborhoods.\n\nDowntown ground-floor standards promote active streets. A new rule clarifies exactly where and how commercial space must occupy the first story along specified corridors. The requirement focuses on high-foot-traffic blocks and exempts quieter edge streets.\n\n\nA simplified zoning map. Five residential districts have been trimmed to four. Outdated zones were retired while new mixed-use districts (M1 and M2) line Market, Washington, and Central Streets to create room for both housing and modern commercial space. These changes steer growth to logical corridors and nodes as identified in Vision Lynn.\n\n\nA modern use table for a modern economy. Biotech labs, clean manufacturing, artisanal production, and breweries are explicitly addressed.\n\nRead more about CommunityScale’s approach to functional zoning use groups.\n\nHousing Opportunity\nThe rewrite preserves Lynn’s 2022 inclusionary-zoning mandate and changes the ability to deliver infill housing:\n\nAccessory dwelling units are now allowed by right.\nDimensional tweaks let duplexes and triple-deckers fit in existing infill lots.\nRebuild grace period for nonconforming structures after a disaster is extended from one year to three, giving owners time to secure financing and permits without losing rights.\nAdaptive reuse of legacy buildings now has a clear path to covert to residential while contributing to historic preservation. Former mills, schools, other commercial buildings, and large pre-1965 residences can be converted to two or more dwellings by special permit.\nA Community-Driven Process\nMayor Nicholson emphasized transparency throughout. The planning team produced an interactive map, videos, and infographics. A multilingual survey and a six-week public-comment period generated formal comments, many of which prompted adjustments and clarifying definitions. A cross-departmental working group drew members from Law, Inspectional Services, EDIC, the Planning Board, the Zoning Board of Appeals, and three City Councilors.\n\n\nMayor Jared C. Nicholson\nCity of Lynn, MA\nComment from the zoning adoption hearing\n\n“The document is a result of extensive public input process that included multiple surveys, community presentations, office hours, videos, and a formal public comment period. A 21st century zoning ordinance will help us achieve our vision for the community for the kind of growth that we’re looking for in jobs and neighborhoods and make the process more predictable, which benefits everyone.”\n\nLynn now has a zoning framework that matches the reality on the ground, encourages balanced growth, and is easy for residents and investors to understand. The City can attract private investment, expand its commercial tax base, and add diverse housing choices while giving residents confidence that change will be guided by transparent, predictable rules.",

This study provides a review of demographic trends, comparable communities, regional influences, and a quantitative deep dive into issues that shape the housing market. The analysis is grounded by interviews with stakeholders such as single-family and multifamily housing developers, regional and local government staff, and housing advocates, as well as an online survey with more than 700 responses.\n\n\nNew homes in Upper Arlington generate municipal revenue exceeding service costs, thus providing a net positive impact on municipal finances. The break-even assessed value per unit is approximately $619K, current market values for new construction easily surpass. The marginal cost to serve a new home in Upper Arlington is a function of services that need to scale with new demand but are not inherently covered by their own fees. Police, fire, EMS, and Parks and Recreation are funded by the City’s general revenue, whereas other services like waste, water, and sewer are covered by fees connected to those services. These expenses are then balanced by revenues from property tax, income tax for work-from-home, and ongoing revenue positive building permit fees for redevelopment and renovation.\n\n\nAs cities grow, the cost of providing essential services per household decreases because the new homes leverage existing infrastructure and distribute expenses such as police, fire protection, and parks across more households. More precisely, the relationship between growth and overall expenses is nonlinear as cities achieve 15% efficiency gains in infrastructure and service provision. Larger cities can provide essential services like police, fire protection, and parks at a lower per-unit cost due to these economies of scale. For Upper Arlington, a 9.8% increase in housing units from 2025-2050 as forecasted by MORPC’s Metropolitan Transportation Plan would only require about 8.2% additional resources. This economy of scale effectively reduces the break even point for revenue from new homes for Upper Arlington.\n\nAccess the project’s landing page and detailed housing forecast.",

From large logistics operations near the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to expanding healthcare and tech positions in urban cores, employers are hiring. Yet, as noted in the 2023 Northern Kentucky Housing Study, this growth has outpaced the area’s current supply of homes.\n\nDefining the needs\nThe study reported that the region needs an additional 6,650 new homes over five years to keep up with economic growth (see WXIX coverage). These homes must be aligned with the full range of incomes and life stages: from young professionals looking for an affordable condo to older adults who want to downsize while staying near family. Our role at CommunityScale was to help local stakeholders translate these findings into action-oriented solutions.\n\nStakeholder engagement\nIn our consulting work, one principle stands out: Strong solutions spring from strong conversations. We facilitated sessions with more than 90 civic and business leaders—people working in real estate, economic development, government offices, and nonprofits. Many of them graciously shared their time and insights during workshops, data walks, and review sessions. They brought forward the unique housing challenges faced in both urban corridors and rural areas.\n\nData-informed, locally driven\nFrom day one, we aimed to balance quantitative data with qualitative expertise. The Northern Kentucky Housing Data Study gave us a baseline for the gaps to fill—especially the “missing middle” homes priced for moderate-income workers. Then, ongoing community meetings and surveys revealed how older adults, first-time buyers, and a variety of local employers all experience Northern Kentucky’s housing dynamics differently.\n\n\nBoone County Judge/Executive Gary Moore (center at the dais) with other regional leaders speak at the event at the Northern Kentucky Area Development District’s office in Florence on Jan. 14, 2024. Photo by Nathan Granger | LINK nky\nTop strategies in the Home For All report\nA flexible “menu of strategies”\nRather than a prescriptive plan, Home For All functions as a menu: 50 strategies that communities can adapt based on local capacity, priorities, and resources (report available at HousingNKY.org). Below are just a few highlights we believe could make an immediate impact:\n\nProactive code enforcement: Many of Northern Kentucky’s older neighborhoods have vacant or deteriorating homes that could be saved and returned to the market. Cost-effective code enforcement helps preserve existing homes and prevents demolition by neglect.\nMissing middle housing strategy: Demand for townhomes, duplexes, and cottages frequently outpaces supply. Streamlined regulations and creative zoning can lower development costs and attract builders interested in these vital home types.\nExpedited permitting: In a growing region, time is of the essence. By coordinating more closely with planning commissions and building departments, localities can help cost-conscious developers increase their pace without compromising safety.\nRegional housing trust fund: If established, such a fund could issue grants or forgivable loans that encourage income-aligned development and preserve affordability. Other cities that use this model have successfully scaled new home construction, adding more entry-level purchase options.\nSmall developer support: Many smaller builders left the industry after the 2008 recession. By offering training, tailored financing, or technical assistance, local officials can jump-start the creation of missing middle homes and spur more competition in the market.\nIn addition, the report highlights strategies like incentives for landlords who accept Housing Choice Vouchers and a “landlord property inventory” system to help match available rentals with tenants quickly. These recommendations underscore that addressing local needs requires public, private, and nonprofit sectors to work in tandem.\n\n\nTara Johnson-Noem\nExecutive Director\nNorthern Kentucky Area Development District\n\n“Home for All is the culmination of a year’s worth of work involving more than 90 community leaders and experts who devoted countless hours to addressing the region’s urgent housing needs. The goal is to close the housing gap across income levels to ensure our children have somewhere to live in our region when they leave home, that our parents can afford to downsize if they wish, and that our teachers and first responders have somewhere to live within a reasonable drive of their workplace.” (nkytribune.com)\n\nHow communities can use these insights\nCrafting local policy\nEach county or municipality has its own set of opportunities and constraints. Boone County leaders, for instance, might prioritize encouraging “downsize-friendly” homes for retirees, while rural counties might focus more on addressing the distance between existing homes and employment centers. The idea is for local governments to pick relevant options from the menu and tailor them.\n\nBolstering economic development\nWe often say that “homes are where jobs sleep at night.” Site selection experts advise businesses to look closely at a region’s housing stock before bringing new operations to town. By taking on more of these strategies—improving the number of diverse homes and simplifying the path to development—Northern Kentucky can more effectively recruit employers, ranging from logistics companies to tech startups.\n\nPartnering with the private sector\nOne strategy we encourage municipalities to explore is forging partnerships with local employers who see housing costs and availability as a top concern. Employers benefit by retaining workers who can live closer to the job site. With the help of philanthropic grants or a newly formed regional housing trust fund, local entities could launch pilot projects near large employment hubs.",

The zoning has been adopted and submitted to the EOHLC for approval.\n\nDedham is one of the 175 communities subject to the law, due to the location of three MBTA commuter rail stations within its border. As with every other MBTA community, Dedham is subject to specific requirements based on the existing number of housing units, the type of MBTA infrastructure to which it has access, and the percentage of land within a half-mile of stations that EOHLC has determined to be “developable”.\n\n\nOver the course of five months, our team members worked from a broad range of options to develop several specific scenarios in GIS that investigated the implications of different zoning options. Together with the client, those scenarios were refined and vetted until a preferred option was selected.\n\nThe proposed scenario was presented to the Planning Board on January 11, 2023. It uses two overlays to achieve the required capacity. The higher density overlay uses dimensional and density requirements similar to residential developments already built or entitled near Corporate Center, at a density of roughly 30 units per acre. The lower density overlay has a density of roughly 15 units per acre.\n\n\nFollowing adoption of the zoning, CommunityScale worked with the Town to complete EOHLC’s compliance calculator and other materials for compliance submission.
